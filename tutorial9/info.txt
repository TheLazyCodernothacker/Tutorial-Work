Variable info time!
ES has some new stuff and has been updated.
When you use code it might not work on certain browsers because it's not the same version.
When you create a variable with the 'var' keyword, it only exists and is changed in the block scope.
If you check for a variable with 'var' in a function, it will then check the global scope, the window.
You can easily manipulate variables in the global scope.
Welcome "let" and "const". When you use let in an if statement, it doesn't change it from previous variables,
it declares a new variable in the block scope. Const works the same way, but it is constant and it cannot be changed.
