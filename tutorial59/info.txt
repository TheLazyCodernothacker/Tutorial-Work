When you a function, you have arguments that are explicit that you type by yourself.
x(5, 10, this) 'this' is invisible
function x (a,b){
    console.log(this); this can change from the way you call it
}
Making predictable functions are now a little bit more complicated. You have to think about the context of the function.
Functions are objects in javascript, making stuff complicated.
Strict mode changes the way 'this' works. 
"this" changes depending on how you call the function.
dog.x() //this is the dog object
'this' when in a function is the object that called the function.
