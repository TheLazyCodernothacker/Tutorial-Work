Javascript is easy to pick up, but stuff works differently.
Javascript doesn't need to be installed unlike others
Engines are things that run code for humans.
Javascript has a lot of different engines that are uses and 
not all of them are the same.
The standard ES and javascript is an implementation of this standard.
If our code needs to be implemented for all of the different engines,
they need to make sure the engines can all use the code with a test.
The test is called 'Test 262' and you can see how much the engines follow
the ES standard. The engines are part of the webbrowser. 
Node.js is the new way to process javascript, because javascript should be
able to be ran in different environments. Node.js holds data on the backened server.
Compiled languages are coding languages that can be understood by computers that
can just be ran. Interpreted is when the language has to be ran from line by line
as you are running it. This is not veryn important in the beginning, just need to make 
sure that the code works for now. Javascript is mainly compiled because of the engine.
The engines normally just use JIT compilation and will then be compiled and ran.
This is an implementation detail and is tied with the engine, and not all engines compiled
and not all interpret.
