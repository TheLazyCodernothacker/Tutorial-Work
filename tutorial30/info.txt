There a few types of loops
All loops have ICU.
They have initilization where they set a variable to something
They have a condition where they figure out what it needs for it to work
They have an update that will change the variable to break the loop.
int i = 0;
while(i < 10){
    //code
    //you need to update the variable so it won't break everything
    //for example i++;
}
for loops do the same thing and put the ICU all into ()
while loops are used to make a loop that will stop when the users says stop for example
for loops are used to make a loop that will stop when the condition is met
