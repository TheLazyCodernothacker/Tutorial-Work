let ages = [12, 34, 15];
//everything in this array are called elements
//elements are accessed by their index
//index starts at 0, cuz computer, lol
console.log(age[2]); //15
ages[i] //i can come from a for loop
ages.length // this is a property and it should be three
ages[ages.length - 1] //this is the last element in the array
//there can be gaps in an array, which can be a lot of undefined
ages.length = 30 //this will make the array 30 elements long and will give us a lot of undefined
//there will be no errors, so this can ruin your day if you don't notice it
age[100] = "hey" //this will make the array at least 100 elements long
//and will give us a lot of undefined
